"""
FUNCTION:
_________

Define a function called most_vowels that accepts a non-empty tuple of
strings and returns an integer representing the number of vowels in the
string that contains the most vowels.

ASSUMPTIONS:
____________

Let's assume y IS a vowel. So there are SIX (6) vowels: a, e, i, o, u, and y.

For example, if passed a tuple containing the strings ‘shangela’, ‘coco’, and ‘mary’,
the function most_vowels will return 3 because the word 'shangela' contains 3 vowels
and 'coco' and 'mary' only contain 2 vowels.

DOCSTRING:
__________

Yes. Full docstrings are needed. Include pre- and post-conditions. Be precise.

DOCTESTS:
_________

Provide TWO (2) useful and different doctests that show me how most_vowels works.
