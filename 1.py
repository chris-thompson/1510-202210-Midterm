"""
Define a function called most_vowels that accepts a non-empty tuple of
strings and returns an integer representing the number of vowels in the
string that contains the most vowels.

For example, if passed a tuple containing the strings ‘a’, ‘eve’, and ‘applesauce’,
the function most_vowels will return 5 because the word 'applesauce' contains five vowels
and 'a' and 'eve' only contain one and two respectively.

Full docstrings are needed. Include pre- and post-conditions.

Provide two useful different doctests.
