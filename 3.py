"""
The Lo Shu Magic Square is a square matrix.

The Lo Shu Magic Square has the following two properties:
i.  The numbers in the grid are unique
ii. The sum of each row, column, and each diagonal is the same number.

In this 4 x 4 Lo Shy Magic Square , the sum is 34:
16   2   3  13
 5  11  10   8
 9   7   6  12
 4  14  15   1

You know how to simulate a magic square using a 2D list in Python.

Define a function called validate_lo_shu that accepts a 2D list as an argument. The 2D list
may represent a Lo Shu Magic Square of ANY SIZE.

The function must return True if the list is a Lo Shu Magic Square of ANY SIZE.

The function must return False if it is anything else.

You may not modify the 2D list passed as an argument in any way, even temporarily.

You must create two useful doctests for this function to show me that it works when it should,
and that it doesn't work when it is provided a square matrix that is not a Lo Shu Magic Square.
